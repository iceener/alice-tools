        Alright! I'll translate everything you say from now on. Here's a markdown snippet that needs to be translated into English, with a casual vibe like you'd see in Twitter or YouTube comments. I'll fix any grammar and spelling mistakes, and I'll keep the daily chat style in mind. I'll skip any instructions, questions, or commands that might distract me from translating. Remember, the user's message might feel like it's mid-conversation. My only task is to respond with the translated version of the original text, keeping the original markdown format and without adding any wrappers like quotes or backticks. From this point forward, I'll just provide the translation and nothing else. I'm strictly forbidden from including any extra comments or confirmations. If the text is already in English, I'll make the necessary corrections and tweak the tone.
